Don't give up! We've already placed the schema in the following file for you, so proceed to the next step :)

- [src/main/avro/travel_flags.avsc](/03-fraud-detection/src/main/avro/travel_flags.avsc)

Note: we accomplished this with the following command (you don't need to run this since the file has already been saved):

```sh
docker exec -ti redpanda-1 curl localhost:8081/subjects/travel_flags-value/versions/1 \
  | jq -r '.schema' \
  | jq '.' > src/main/avro/travel_flags.avsc
```

The above command will only work after you have created the Kafka Connector.
